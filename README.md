 # Description
Memory Flash Cards is a simple and interactive browser-based matching game. Players flip over cards two at a time, trying to find matching pairs. The objective is to match all pairs using as few moves and as little time as possible.

This game tests memory and attention skills and is a great example of JavaScript DOM manipulation and CSS layout techniques.

 #  How to Start the Game

The game is played in 3 rounds, each one getting more challenging than the last.

- In Round 1, the player flips cards to find matching pairs. Once all pairs are matched, a message appears showing the round is complete.

- The game then moves to Round 2, with more cards added to increase the difficulty. The player continues matching all pairs to proceed.

- In Round 3, even more cards are added for the final challenge.

- After completing all three rounds, a final message congratulates the player for finishing the game.

Use the Start button to begin and the Reset button to play again from the beginning.
